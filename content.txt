1. Class and object (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and it has function/methods
    > Code Walkthrough
    > attribute get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? -> everything in python is an object (data structure, data type etc.)
4. Advantages of OOPs:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic/dunder methods
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class also

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method 

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > Why interitance is needed? (code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
    > What gets inherited ? - Constructor, non-private attributes, non-private methods
    > constructor overloading and method overloading
    > Super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not access variables/ attributes can only be used inside a class)
    > Types of inheritance:
        1. Single Inheritance
        2. Multilevel Inheritance
        3. Hierarchical Inheritance
        4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> 
        5. Hybrid Inheritance
