3. Why Python is called OOP? -> everything in python is an object (data structure, data type etc.)
4. Advantages of OOPs:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic/dunder methods
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class also

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method 

    > Inheritance
